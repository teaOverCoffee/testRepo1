# testRepo1
Just starting out with my first experience with version control.

Heya, how are you all? Let's get started on git now.

A new change has been made to this file

Some more changes done to this file. Used vi editor for this. Well, vi is actually tough to use, but that's stil[l] fun. [a small typo there by the master branch :D]

The changes are now done by me and I'm the newBranch1. Hello from my side.
